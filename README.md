# Ideal-Piano

[中文](https://github.com/Rainbow-Dreamer/Ideal-Piano/blob/master/README_cn.md)

## Introduction

This is a smart piano software that I started to develop in April 2020.

The best feature of Ideal Piano is that it uses algorithm based on music theory to determine what chord types you are currently playing and displays it on the screen. This algorithm comes from my another project [musicpy](https://github.com/Rainbow-Dreamer/musicpy), a python library to compose and analyze music, if you are interested in it, please check it. This algorithm could detect all root position chords, chord inversions, voicings and chords which have altered notes, omissions, from simple chords to very complex chords.



## Functionality

* You can use your computer keyboard or MIDI keyboard to play, keyboard mappings with notes could be customized in the settings file
* Analyze what chord types you are playing in details and display on the screen
* Choose MIDI files to playback in waterfall form, show current chord types in real time, you can also choose to display detailed music theory information for the current chord
* Support playing MIDI files with multiple tracks, change playback position by clicking on the progression bar when playing
* You can choose to split the melody and chord parts of MIDI files and play only one of them, using music analysis algorithm based on music theory
* You can choose to analyze current key you are playing or MIDI files in real time using music analysis algorithm based on music theory, supporting major, minor and church modes like dorian, lydian (experimental)
* Load audio files or SoundFont files as instruments
* Connect with DAW and analyze chord types that is currently playing in the DAW
* Fully customizable UI, easily change background image, font type, font size, customize piano keyboard, etc.
* You can choose to display corresponding note names on piano keys (by default the note names are not displayed on the piano keys)

## Building from source

If you cannot run the executables on your current system, the best solution is to build from source code.

Take Linux as an example, the executable build from Ubuntu 21.10 may not work on Ubuntu 22.04 due to some core libraries differences and other incompatible issues with newer versions.

For information on how to build Ideal Piano from source, please check user instructions in `User Manuals` folder.



## Other notes

Currently supported languages only include English and Chinese, you can change the language by change the setting parameter `language`.
